      Chapter 8 - Iterating and testing


  The first step in writing good software is to make sure your application works like the customer expects and wants it to.
  Customers don’t usually care about diagrams and lists.  They want to see your software actually do something.

      Chapter 7 : Design Principles

  With classes doing one single thing through the SRP, it is even easier to apply the OCP to your code.
  When you’re trying to determine if a method is the responsibility of a class, ask yourself, is it this class’s job...

  Architecture helps you turn all your diagrams, plans and feature lists into well-ordered application.
  The features in your system that are most important to your project are architecture significant.
