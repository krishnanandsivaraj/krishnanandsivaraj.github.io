## Chapter 5 : Solving really big problem

- You solve big problems the way you solve small problems.
- The best way to look at a big problem is to see it as lots of individual pieces of functionality.
- You can treat each of these problems as individual problem or solve and apply the things you already know.
- Commonality and variability
  - **commanity** : figure out what the system is like
  - **variability** : figure out what the system is not like

> Get features from the customers and then figure out the requirements you need to implement those features.
>
- use cases don't always help you see the big picture.
- Always defer details as long as you can.
- You still need to know what your system is supposed to do, but you need a big picture.  That is where use case diagrams fit in.

> **Domain Analysis** is the process of identifying, collecting, organising and representing relevant information of a domain based upon the study of existing systems and their development histories, knowledge captured from domain experts.

## Summary / Takeaways

- The best way to look at a problem is to view the problem as a collection of smaller problems.
- Just like in smaller projects start working on bigger projects by gathering features and requirements.
- Commonality and variability give you points of comparison between a new system and things you already know about.
- use cases are detail oriented, use case diagrams are focused more on the big picture.
- Use case diagrams should account for all the features in your system.
- Domain language is representing a system in language that the customer will understand.
- An actor is anything that interacts with your system but isn't a part of the system.
