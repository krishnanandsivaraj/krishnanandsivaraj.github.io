## Chapter 3 : Requirements change

>
>A complete path through a usecase from the first step to the last is called a scenario.

> Most usecases have several different scenarios but they always share the same goal.
>

## Summary / Takeaways

- Requirements will always change as a project progresses.
- When requirement changes, your system has to evolve to handle new requirements.
- When your system need to work in a different way, update the use case.
- **scenario** - a single path through a use case from start to end.
- A single use case can have multiple scenarios as long as each scenario has its own goal.
- **alternate path** - steps that occur only some of the time or provide completely different paths.
- Try to avoid duplicate code.
