## Summary / Takeaways

- **Let the customer talk.**  First you need to know what the system needs to do. *How* the system should do will happen later.
- Convert whatever you have heard into a requirement.
- Consider **alternate path**
  - *alternate path* : consider what might go wrong and update to handle that in the requirement list.
- Considering all the steps to complete this requirement, it becomes  **use case**.
  - *use case* : techniques for capturing the potential requirements of a new system or software change.  Each use case provides one or more *sceanrios* that convey how the system would *interact* with the end user or another system to achieve a *specific goal*
- **use case** has three parts - clear value (should achieve customer goals), start and stop, external initiator.
