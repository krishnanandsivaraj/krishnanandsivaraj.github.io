## Chapter 6 : Architecture

- Architecture helps you turn all your diagrams, plans and feature lists into well-ordered application.
- The features in your system that are most important to your project are architecture significant.
- Focus on features that are essence of the system, that you're unsure about meeting of, or unclear about how to implement first.
- Everything you do in architecture stages should reduce the risk of the project failing.
- If you don't need all the details of the use case, writing a scenario will help.
- When you are not sure about a feature ask it to the customer, then try to generalize the answers you get into a good understanding of the feature.
- use commonality analysis to build software that are flexible.
